--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACKERMAN------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE
	-> defined a 2D array store to store all the values of ackerman function obtained in the process of running code
	-> stored some basic value at the start to make it run more fast
	-> the function first stores the result into the list store and returns the element
	
IMPROVEMENT
	-> this program can find values for ack(3,7) and ack(3,8) which is not possible before
	-> before when we try to calculate for these pairs an error
		RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
	-> comes which is now gone
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEXT PROCESSING--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE 
	-> defined a function analyse which opens and reads the file and takes the vowel count of each word into a list
	=> used map to get a list of lists corresponding to each text files which in this case is 5
	-> that list we get for this case is 
		[[3, 3, 1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2, 2, 3], [4, 5, 3, 6, 0], [1, 3, 2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 2, 1, 2]]
	-> defined a function sum
	-> defined a function avg which uses the function sum 
	=> used reduce for reducing the whole list into a single number which in this case is the sum
	=> used map to map the list of lists i.e list_level_2 and  list of averages i.e list_final
	-> we get the list as
		[2.0, 1.6, 3.6, 1.6, 1.8]
	=> defined a function top which is used to filter
	-> used a copy of list_final i.e lis for deleting the max elements one by one 
	-> printed top 1,2,3 files with their avg values output we get for this case is
		Top 1 data3.txt 3.6
		Top 2 data1.txt 2.0
		Top 3 data5.txt 1.8
	-> used data files
	
MAP 
	-> line 28, 37

REDUCE
	-> line 35

FILTER
	-> line 47, 56
	
	used => above for usage of higher order functions map, reduce, filter
