PROBLEM 0

	considering the products as calculators and features as
        some mathematical functions.
   
        parental hierarchy
   
	productC is super class.
	productB is subclass of productC.
	productA is subclass of productB.	
	
	productC
        -> super class with only feature 1
        -> feature1 - only simple arithmetic operations.
        
        productB
        -> child class with feature 2 added
        -> feature 3 - some other mathematical operations got added
        
        productA
        -> child class of subclass productB
        -> feature 2 - some other mathematical operations got added
        
        productC -> has feature 1
        productB -> has features 1 & 3
        productA -> has features 1, 3 & 2
        
PROBLEM 1

	constructed a class laptop with all basic member functions.
	constructed 2 classes feature1, feature2 for HDD and SSD
	
	All the 5 laptop classes are inherited from these 3 classes.
	Used a constructor inside each class to specify it's details.

PROBLEM 2

	constructed a class basicTV
	all the 4 tv's got inherited from this class, this also a method.
	all the tv specific features are in the subclasses.
	
PROBLEM 3
	
	constructed a class basicphone with all basic member functions.
	constructed 2 classes feature1, feature2 for storage expansion and battery replacement
	
	All the 6 phone classes are inherited from these 3 classes.
	Used a constructor inside each class to specify it's details.
	
I wrote the code for given pictures only, so uploding the same.
